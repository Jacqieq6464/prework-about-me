                            <p>Marvin Pentz Gaye, Jr., also known as the "Prince of Soul," was born in Washington, D.C., on April 2, 1939. Gaye was raised under the strict control of his father, Reverend Marvin Gay Sr. Marvin Gaye Jr. added the "e" on the end of his name later in life, the minister at a local church, against a bleak backdrop of widespread violence in his neighbourhood</p>

                            <p>Throughout his childhood, Gaye often found peace in music, mastering the piano and drums at a young age. Until high school, his singing experience was limited to church revivals, but soon he developed a love for R&B and doo-wop that would set the foundation for his career. In the late 1950s, Gaye joined a vocal group called The New Moonglows.</p>
                <h2>Political Message</h2>
                    <p>In 1970, inspired by escalating violence and political unrest over the Vietnam War, Gaye wrote the landmark song What's Going On. Despite clashes with Motown over the song's creative direction, the single was released in 1971 and became an instant smash. Its success prompted Gaye to take even more risks, both musically and politically. When it was released in the spring of 1971, the What's Going OnÂ album served to open Gaye up to new audiences while maintaining his Motown following.</p>
                <h2>Death & Legacy</h2>
                    <p>Despite his successful comeback in the early 1980s, Gaye struggled badly with the substance abuse and bouts of depression that had plagued him for most of his life. After his last tour, he moved into his parents' house. There he and his father fell into a pattern of violent fights and quarrels that recalled conflicts that had haunted the family for decades. On April 1, 1984, Marvin Gaye Sr. shot and killed his son after a physical altercation; the father claimed he acted in self-defence but would later be convicted of involuntary manslaughter.</p>
